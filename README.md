> Gradle plugin to report various kinds of summaries to console.  

This plugin will aggregate test reports and show them to console.  
It's useful when you use CI services that don't save artifacts.

## Available reports

* JUnit test report
* JaCoCo coverage report
* Cobertura coverage report
* Istanbul (Node) coverage report

## Usage

### Getting started

Just apply the plugin in your build.gradle.

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'com.github.ksoichiro.console.reporter' version '0.6.3'
}
```

Or

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.ksoichiro:gradle-console-reporter:0.6.3'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.ksoichiro.console.reporter'
```

### Test report

When your tests fail, the plugin would print test failure details to the console.

```console
$ ./gradlew test
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
:test

com.example.ATest > greet3 FAILED
    org.junit.ComparisonFailure at ATest.java:31

com.example.ATest > greet FAILED
    org.junit.ComparisonFailure at ATest.java:19

com.example.BTest > greet FAILED
    org.junit.ComparisonFailure at BTest.java:18

5 tests completed, 3 failed

You can suppress stacktrace by configuring the plugin.  
See [configurations](#configurations) section for details.

### JaCoCo coverage report

If you're using JaCoCo gradle plugin,
you can see the coverage at the end of builds:

```console
$ ./gradlew check

Coverage summary:
project1:                 72.2%
project2-with-long-name:   4.0%

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 0s
9 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 8 up-to-date
```

### Cobertura coverage report

If you're using [stevesaliman/gradle-cobertura-plugin](https://github.com/stevesaliman/gradle-cobertura-plugin),
you can see the coverage at the end of builds:

```console
$ ./gradlew cobertura check

> Task :instrument
Cobertura 2.1.1 - GNU GPL License (NO WARRANTY) - See COPYRIGHT file

> Task :test
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (net.sourceforge.cobertura.coveragedata.TouchCollector).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.

> Task :generateCoberturaReport
Cobertura 2.1.1 - GNU GPL License (NO WARRANTY) - See COPYRIGHT file
Report time: 198ms
Cobertura 2.1.1 - GNU GPL License (NO WARRANTY) - See COPYRIGHT file

Coverage summary:
cobertura:  71.4%

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
```

## Tasks

### reportTest

Print JUnit test report.  
This task will be executed automatically after `test` task's failure by default, so you don't need to call it.

### reportJacoco

Print JaCoCo coverage report.  
This task will be executed automatically after `jacocoTestReport` task by default, so you don't need to call it.

### reportCobertura

Print Cobertura coverage report.  
This task will be executed automatically after `cobertura` task by default, so you don't need to call it.
